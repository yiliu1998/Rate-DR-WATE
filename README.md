# RDRwate
Rate doubly robust (RDR) estimation for weighted average treatment effects (WATEs). We developed an R package (`RDRwate`) implementing three RDR estimators for WATE, a general class of causal estimands. We allow users implement the estimation and inference for a number of popular WATEs in the class, including ATE, ATT, ATC, ATO (overlap weights), ATM (matching weights), ATEN (entropy weights), and ATB (beta family weights).
