Description: The package implements rate doubly robust (RDR) estimation for weighted average treatment effect (WATE). It includes a number of popular WATEs. 
    The proposed estimators include the efficient influence function (EIF) based estimator and two double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimators (applying the cross-fitting algorithm to the EIF estimator).
