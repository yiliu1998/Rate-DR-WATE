Description: The package implements rate doubly robust (RDR) estimation for weighted average treatment effect (WATE). 
    It includes a number of popular WATEs (ATE [overall], ATT [treated], ATC [controls], ATO [overlap weights], ATM [matching weights], ATEN [entropy weights], and ATB [beta weights]). 
    The proposed estimators include the efficient influence function (EIF) based estimator and two double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimators (applying the cross-fitting algorithm to the EIF estimator).
